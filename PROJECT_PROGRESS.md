## Strategic Decisions & Reasoning

### Data Source Strategy Decision: HYBRID APPROACH
**Decision:** Implement a mixture of manual curation + API integration
**Reasoning:** 
- Manual curation ensures quality control and allows us to start immediately
- API integration (ShareASale, Impact, CJ Affiliate) scales the platform automatically
- Hybrid approach reduces risk - if APIs fail, manual content keeps site functional
- Allows testing which approach generates better conversion rates

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Start with manual data entry for 20-30 popular stores
2. Build API integration architecture for future scaling
3. Add admin interface for manual coupon management

### Initial Store Selection: WIDE NET STRATEGY
**Decision:** Target 50+ major retailers across multiple categories
**Reasoning:**
- More stores = more traffic opportunities through long-tail SEO
- Diverse categories reduce dependency on single verticals
- Higher chance of capturing users regardless of their shopping intent
- Better data for understanding which categories convert best

**Target Categories:** Electronics, Fashion, Home & Garden, Travel, Food Delivery, Streaming Services, Software, Beauty, Sports, Books

### Content Strategy: MVP-FIRST APPROACH
**Decision:** Defer complex content management, focus on core functionality
**Reasoning:**
- Get revenue-generating features live first
- Validate market demand before investing in content infrastructure
- Blog/content can be added as Phase 2 enhancement
- Core coupon functionality is the primary value proposition
